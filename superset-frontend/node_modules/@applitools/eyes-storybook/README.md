## Installation

### Install npm package

Install Eyes-Storybook as a local dev dependency in your tested project:

```bash
npm install --save-dev @applitools/eyes-storybook
```

### Applitools API key

In order to authenticate via the Applitools server, you need to supply the Eyes-Storybook SDK with the API key you got from Applitools. Read more about how to obtain the API key [here](https://applitools.com/docs/topics/overview/obtain-api-key.html).

To do this, set the environment variable `APPLITOOLS_API_KEY` to the API key before running your tests.
For example, on Linux/Mac:

```bash
export APPLITOOLS_API_KEY=<your_key>
```

And on Windows:

```bash
set APPLITOOLS_API_KEY=<your_key>
```

## Usage

After completing the installation and defining the API key, you will be able to run Eyes-Storybook from the command line and let it take screenshots of all your stories.

If your project is using the default storybook config folder (i.e. `<project_folder>/.storybook`), then run the following command:

```bash
npx eyes-storybook
```

### Configuring local storybook server

Normally, Eyes-Storybook starts a storybook dev server in an available port between 9000-9010 for the duration of the tests. It's possible to pass arguments to Eyes-Storybook to configure the local storybook server:

- `--storybook-port OR -p`: Port to run storybook (passed as `-p` to `start-storybook`).
- `--storybook-host OR -h`: Host to run storybook (passed as `-h` to `start-storybook`).
- `--storybook-config-dir OR -c`: Directory where to load Storybook configurations from (passed as `-c` to `start-storybook`)
- `--storybook-static-dir OR -s`: Directory where to load static files from, comma-separated list (passed as `-s` to `start-storybook`)

### Standalone server

As noted in the previous section, Eyes-Storybook starts a storybook dev server. If you wish to start the server outside of Eyes-Storybook, or test a production build that's available at a certain URL, then just specify the URL for the storybook in the command line (or in the configuration file, see [Advanced configuration](#advanced-configuration) below).

For example:

```bash
npx eyes-storybook -u http://localhost:6006
```

Or for a production storybook:

```bash
npx eyes-storybook -u http://react.carbondesignsystem.com/
```

### Command line arguments

The full list of command line arguments can be viewed by running `npx eyes-storybook --help`:

  --readStoriesTimeout, --read-stories-timeout      The time to wait until all stories are read, before starting the visual tests    [number]
  --exitcode, -e                                    If tests failed close with non-zero exit code                                   [boolean]
```

## Concurrency

The default level of concurrency for free accounts is `5`. This means that only up to 5 visual tests can run in parallel, and therefore the execution might be slow.
If your account does support a higher level of concurrency, it's possible to pass a different value by specifying it in the property `testConcurrency` in the applitools.config.js file (see [Advanced configuration](#advanced-configuration) section below).

If you are interested in speeding up your visual tests, contact sdr@applitools.com to get a trial account and faster tests with more concurrency.

Possible values for **level** are `None`, `AA` and `AAA`, and possible values for **guidelinesVersion** are `WCAG_2_0` and `WCAG_2_1`. For example: `{level: 'AA', guidelinesVersion: 'WCAG_2_0'}`. For more information, see [per component  configuration - accessibilityValidation](#accessibilityValidation)|
|`layoutBreakpoints`| undefined | When set to `true`, a snapshot of the DOM will be taken once for each browser/device size in the `browser` configuration. For optimization purposes, an array of numbers can be passed. The DOM snapshot will be taken once for every **width** in the array. For more information, see [per component  configuration - layoutBreakpoints](#layoutBreakpoints)|
|`sendDom`| true | A flag to specify whether a capture of DOM and CSS should be taken when rendering the screenshot. The default value is true. This should only be modified to troubleshoot unexpected behavior, and not for normal production use. For more information, see [per component  configuration - sendDom](#sendDom)|
| `visualGridOptions` | undefined | An object that specifies options to configure renderings on the Ultrafast grid. See more information [per component  configuration - visualGridOptions](#visualgridoptions) |

There are 2 ways to specify test configuration:

1) Environment variables
2) The `applitools.config.js` file

The list above is also the order of precedence, which means that if you specify a property as an environment variable, it will override the value defined for the same property in the `applitools.config.js` file.

### Method 1: Environment variables

The name of the corresponding environment variable is in uppercase, with the `APPLITOOLS_` prefix, and separating underscores instead of camel case:

```js
APPLITOOLS_APP_NAME
APPLITOOLS_SHOW_LOGS
APPLITOOLS_BATCH_ID
APPLITOOLS_BATCH_NAME
APPLITOOLS_BATCH_SEQUENCE_NAME
APPLITOOLS_PROXY
APPLITOOLS_NOTIFY_ON_COMPLETION
...
// all other configuration variables apply as well..
```

### Method 2: The `applitools.config.js` file

It's possible to have a file called `applitools.config.js` at the current working directory (the directory you are at when running the `eyes-storybook` script). In this file specify the desired configuration, as an exported CommonJS module. For example:

```js
module.exports = {
  appName: 'My app',
  showLogs: true,
  batchName: 'My batch'
  ...
  // all other configuration variables apply
}
```

## Configuring the browser

Eyes-Storybook will take a screenshot of the page as specified in the `browser` configuration parameter.

Possible values are:

- `chrome`
- `firefox`
- `edgechromium`
- `edgelegacy`
- `ie10`
- `ie11`
- `safari`
- `chrome-one-version-back`
- `chrome-two-versions-back`
- `firefox-one-version-back`
- `firefox-two-versions-back`
- `safari-one-version-back`
- `safari-two-versions-back`
- `edgechromium-one-version-back`
- `edgechromium-two-versions-back`

### Previous browser versions

`*-one-version-back` and `*-two-versions-back` are relative to the version of the same browser. For example, if `chrome` refers to version 79, then `chrome-one-version-back` will be Chrome 78 and `chrome-two-versions-back` will be Chrome 77.

### Getting a screenshot of multiple browsers in parallel

It's also possible to send an array of browsers, for example in the `applitools.config.js` file:

```js
module.exports = {
  browser: [
    {width: 800, height: 600, name: 'firefox'},
    {width: 1024, height: 768, name: 'chrome'},
    {width: 1024, height: 768, name: 'ie11'}
  ]
}
```

### Device emulation

To enable chrome's device emulation, it's possible to send a device name and screen orientation, for example:

```js
module.exports = {
  browser: {
    deviceName: 'iPhone X',
    screenOrientation: 'landscape',
    name: 'chrome' // optional, just to make it explicit this is browser emulation and not a real device. Only chrome is supported for device emulation.
  }
}
```

Possible values for screen orientation are `landscape` and `portrait`, and if no value is specified, the default is `portrait`.

The list of device names is available at https://github.com/applitools/eyes.sdk.javascript1/blob/master/packages/eyes-api/src/enums/DeviceName.ts

In addition, it's possible to use chrome's device emulation with custom viewport sizes, pixel density and mobile mode, by passing `deviceScaleFactor` and `mobile` in addition to `width` and `height`. For example:

```js
module.exports = {
  browser: {
    width: 800,
    height: 600,
    deviceScaleFactor: 3,
    mobile: true,
    name: 'chrome' // optional, just to make it explicit this is browser emulation and not a real device. Only chrome is supported for device emulation.
  }
}
```

### iOS device

```js
module.exports = {
  browser: {
    iosDeviceInfo: {
      deviceName: 'iPhone XR',
      screenOrientation: 'landscape', // optional, default: 'portrait'
      iosVersion: 'latest' // optional, default: undefined (i.e. the default is determined by the Ultrafast grid)
    },
  }
}
```

The list of devices is available at https://github.com/applitools/eyes.sdk.javascript1/blob/master/packages/eyes-api/src/enums/IosDeviceName.ts

Possible values for `iosVersion` are:

- `'latest'` - the latest iOS version that's supported by the UFG
- `'latest-1'` - one version prior to the latest version
- `undefined` - the UFG's default

## Faking IE Browser

Some pages render differently on Internet Explorer and as such, it may be important to take the dom-snapshot while running on a fake IE browser using the ultrafast grid.

Using the `fakeIE` flag - you can render the stories on a chrome masquerading as IE.

We do this by simulating the `userAgent` and `documentMode` of the page - making the page believe it is being rendered on IE.

There is a small performance impact when using fake IE tests - since the browser needs to fake IE for each story it renders.

## Per component configuration

**_Only supported in Storybook version >= 4_**

There are two ways to provide configuration for a specific story, or a group of stories.

1. **As an argument to the story** - It's possible to pass a third argument to storybook's `.add` function to customize each story. An `eyes` property on the parameters object can be specified with configuration properties.

2. **In the global configuration file, `applitools.config.js`** - If a function is specified for one of the properties below, it will be called for each story, and will be passed the story's metadata, of the structure `{name, kind, parameters}`, where `name` is the name of the component, `kind` is the string built by storybook for the category, e.g. `Forms|Input/Text`, and `parameters` are the third argument to storybook's `.add` function. The function should return the configuration value for the specific property+story.

_Specifying a value locally in the story takes precedence over the global config value._

**The following properties are supported:**

### `include`

#### global

When provided globally, `include` is a function that receives the story's `kind` and `name`,  `storyTitle` and `parameters`.
All these properties except  `storyTitle` come from `storybook` and they represent the hierarchy of the stories:
- `kind` - The stories directory and section, where applicable. Nested directory structures are allowed in `storybook`. These will be suffixed by `/`, while a section - that can hold many directories will be suffixed with a `|`.
  For example: 
  - Story named `Button` in the `Components` directory - its `kind` will be `Components`.
  - Story named `Button` in the `Components` directory under the `App` section - its `kind` will be `App|Components`.
  - Story named `RadioButton` in the `Radio` subdirectory of the `Components` directory under the `App` section - its `kind` will be `App|Components/Radio`.
- `name` - the story name.
  For example: 
  - Story named `Button` in the `Components` directory - its `name` will be `Button`.
- `parameters` - custom parameters that can specified in the story.

`storyTitle` is generated by the SDK and is used as the test name. Therefore it is easy to find and filter by it.

More information can be found in the [Storybook docs - Naming components and hierarchy](https://storybook.js.org/docs/react/writing-stories/naming-components-and-hierarchy).

You can filter by `kind`, `name`, `storyTitle`, `parameters`, a combination of them or any logic that will result in a `boolean`. For example:
```js
// applitools.config.js
module.exports = {
  ...
  // given the example above
  // visually test only the stories in the 'Radio' subdirectory
  include: ({kind}) => {
    return kind === 'App|Components/Radio'
  }
  ...
}
```

When passing a `storyTitle` as a `string` only this story will be tested. For example:

```js
module.exports = {
...
include: "Button: with text",
...
}
```

When passing a `storyTitle` as a `Regex` only matching stories will be tested. For example:

```js
module.exports = {
...
include: /Button: */,
...
}
```
> NOTE you can use regular expressions or any other method you'd like, as long as you return a `boolean` from this function

#### component

When `false`, the component will not be visually tested. For example:

```js
// This story will not be tested visually
storiesOf('Some kind', module)
  .add(
    'Some story',
    () => <div>I am visually perfect!</div>,
    {eyes: {include: false}}
  )
```

### `variations`

An array of object values, which specifies which variations to add for this story. For each value, an additional visual test will be executed for the component. Each variation could contain `queryParams` and `properties` fields to specifies custom query parameters and eyes properties respectfully. Variation tests will have the same name.

This can accommodate many use cases, for example `@storybook/addon-contexts`. With addons like this it is possible to render components in a different way depends on query parameters in URL. For Example, here's a storybook that handles an RTL variation:

```js
const isRTL = new URL(window.location).searchParams.get('eyes-variation') === 'RTL';

if (isRTL) {
  document.documentElement.setAttribute('dir', 'rtl')
}

// 2 visual tests will be created - one for LTR and one for RTL
storiesOf('Components that support RTL', module)
  .add(
    'Some story',
    () => <div>
        <span>I am visually perfect!</span>
        <span>{isRTL ? ' and rendered right to left as well :)' : ''}</span>
      </div>,
    {eyes: {variations: [{queryParams: {'eyes-variation': 'RTL'}, properties: {name: 'isRTL', value: 'true'}, {properties: {name: 'isRTL', value: 'false'}}]}}
  )
```

### `waitBeforeCapture`

Selector or timeout, see [advanced configuration](#advanced-configuration) for more details.

```js
storiesOf('Components with a waitBeforeCapture', module)
  .add(
    'Some story',
    () => <span id="container" class="loading"></span>,
    {eyes: { waitBeforeCapture: '#container.ready' }}
  );
```

_Note that the predicate option for `waitBeforeCapture` is currently not available in the per component configuration._

### `properties`

Adds custom properties for each test. These show up in Test Manager, and tests can be grouped by custom properties. By default, Eyes-Storybook adds 2 custom properties for each test: the **Component name** and **State** of each component. Adding more properties via this config param will **not** override these two properties.

For example:

```js
storiesOf('Components with custom properties', module)
  .add(
    'Some story',
    () => <span id="container" class="loading"></span>,
    {eyes: { properties: [
      {name: 'some prop #1', value: 'some value #1'},
      {name: 'some prop #2', value: 'some value #2'},
    ] }}
  );
```

### `ignoreRegions`

A single or an array of regions to ignore when checking for visual differences. For example:

```js
storiesOf('Components with ignored region', module)
  .add(
    'Some story',
    () =>
      <div>
        <span>I am visually perfect!</span>
        <span className="ignore-this">this should be ignored</span>
      </div>,
    {eyes: {
      ignoreRegions: [
        {selector: '.ignore-this'}, // by css selector
        {left: 10, top: 20, width: 200, height: 80} // by absolute coordinates
      ]}
    }
  )
```

### `floatingRegions`

An array of regions to consider as floating when comparing the checkpoint screenshot with the baseline screenshot. For example:

```js
storiesOf('Components with floating region', module)
  .add(
    'Some story',
    () =>

        <span>I am visually perfect!</span>
        <span className="floating-region">this should be floating</span>
      </div>,
    {eyes: {
      floatingRegions: [
        { // by selector
          selector: '.floating-region',
          maxUpOffset: 10,
          maxDownOffset: 20,
          maxLeftOffset: 30,
          maxRightOffset: 40,
        },

        }
      ]}
    }
  )
```

### `layoutRegions`

```js
storiesOf('Components with layout region', module)
  .add(
    'Some story',
    () =>
      <div>
        <span>I am visually perfect!</span>
        <span className="layout-region">this should be compared with layout match level</span>
      </div>,
    {eyes: {
      layoutRegions: [
        {selector: '.layout-region'}, // by css selector

        {selector: '.strict-region'}, // by css selector
        {left: 10, top: 20, width: 200, height: 80} // by absolute coordinates
      ]}
    }
  )
```

### `accessibilityRegions`

A single or an array of regions for accessibility checking. For example:

      }
    }}
  )
});
```

Possible values for `level` are: `AA` and `AAA`.
Possible values for `guidelinesVersion` are: `WCAG_2_0` and `WCAG_2_1`.

### `ignoreDisplacements`

Sets whether Test Manager should intially display mismatches for image features that have only been displaced, as opposed to real mismatches. For example:

```js
storiesOf('Components with ignoreDisplacements', module)
  .add(
    'Some story',
    () => <div>
      <span>I am visually perfect!</span>
    </div>,
    {eyes: {
      ignoreDisplacements: true
    }}
  )
});
```

### `sendDom`

```js
  storiesOf('Components', module)
    .add(
      'Some story ',
      () =>
        <div>Some Story</div>, { 
          eyes: { 
            sendDom: false
          }
        })
```

### `visualGridOptions`

An object that specifies options to configure renderings on the Ultrafast grid.
Available options:

* `polyfillAdoptedStyleSheets`: Creates a polyfill when the DOM contains `adoptedStyleSheets` ([reference](https://developers.google.com/web/updates/2019/02/constructable-stylesheets)) for browsers that don't support it (It is currently supported only in Chrome). When `true`, those browsers will successfully include the css as inline style tags. When `false`, the css will not be included. When `undefined`, an error will be thrown with a message stating that this feature is not supported in the desired browser. 
* `ieV2`: Use IE environment v2 in the UFG.

```js
  storiesOf('Components', module)
    .add(
      'Some story ',
      () =>
        <div>Some Story</div>, { 
          eyes: { 
            visualGridOptions: {
              polyfillAdoptedStyleSheets: true,
              ieV2: true
            }
          }
        })
```



### `scriptHooks`

A set of scripts to be run by the browser during the rendering. It is intended to be used as a means to alter the page's state and structure at the time of rendering. 
An object with the following properties:

  #### beforeCaptureScreenshot 
  A script that runs after the page is loaded but before taking the screenshot. For example:


  ```js
  storiesOf('Components', module)
    .add(
      'Some story',
      () =>
        <div>Some Story</div>, { 
          eyes: { 
            scriptHooks: {
              beforeCaptureScreenshot: "document.body.style.backgroundColor = 'gold'"
            }
          }
        })
  ```

## Parameters that cannot be set as an [advanced configuration](#advanced-configuration)

### `runBefore` and `runAfter` functions

The `runBefore` function can be used to perform any action prior to taking the story snapshot. The `runAfter` method should be used to cleanup any side-effect that `runBefore` creates, if there are any.   
For example, if `runBefore` adds a class to the `body` element, this class should be removed in `runAfter`. This is because the browser tab's window is not reloaded between stories.

 _Note: `rootEl` also needs to be cleaned up, so any modification that was done on this element in `runBefore` should be reverted in `runAfter`._

#### `runBefore`

An asynchronous function that will be evaluated before the story's screenshot is taken. This is the place to perform any interaction with the story using DOM API's.

For performing various DOM interactions, we recommend checking out [dom-testing-library](https://github.com/testing-library/dom-testing-library). It provides utilities to interact, query and wait for conditions on the DOM.

For example, a component that renders a popover could trigger the opening of the popover and wait for content to appear:

```js
// these are utilities from dom-testing-library
import {wait, within, fireEvent} from '@testing-library/dom';

// <Popover /> is a component in your UI library.
// The assumption in this example is that it is opened by an element with the text 'Open',
// and then that element's text changes to 'Close':
storiesOf('UI components', module)
  .add('Popover', () => <Popover />, {
    eyes: {
      runBefore({rootEl, story}) {
        fireEvent.click(within(rootEl).getByText('Open'))
        return wait(() => within(rootEl).getByText('Close'))
      }
    },
  })
```

#### `runAfter`

An asynchronous function that is evaluated after the story's screenshot is taken. This is the place to perform any clean ups that could change the way the next story renders.

For example, reverting back to the original background color that was changed by a previous component:

```js
.add('background color', () => (
  <div style={{fontSize: '30px'}}>Component with runBefore hook that modifies the background color</div>
  ), {
  eyes: {
    runBefore({rootEl, story}) {
     window.originalBackgoundColor = document.querySelector("html").style.backgroundColor;
     document.querySelector("html").style.backgroundColor = 'fuchsia';
    },
    runAfter({rootEl, story}){
     document.querySelector("html").style.backgroundColor = window.originalBackgoundColor;
     delete window.originalBackgoundColor;
    }
  }
})
```

### `layoutBreakpoints`

```js
  storiesOf('Components', module)
    .add(
      'Some story with breakpoints for all browser and device sizes',
      () =>
        <div>Some Story</div>, { 
          eyes: { 
            layoutBreakpoints: true
          }
        })
    .add(
      'Some story with breakpoints for desktop and mobile',
      () =>
        <div>Some Story</div>, { 
          eyes: { 
            layoutBreakpoints: [500, 1200]
          }
        })
```

## Running Eyes-Storybook in Docker

When running the SDK in docker, there might be issues related to properly launching the internal chrome browser via puppeteer. If you seem to have such issues, set `runInDocker: true` in your config file. This will pass the internal chrome browser special arguments, as described [here](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/puppeteer/blob/master/docs/troubleshooting.md#tips).

If you still have issues, you might need to follow the instructions to use your own chromium browser in the docker container, and point that to the SDK's puppeteer. Follow the instructions [here](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/puppeteer/blob/master/docs/troubleshooting.md#running-puppeteer-in-docker) and set the `executablePath` via the `puppeteerOptions`. For example, `applitools.config.js`:

```js
module.exports = {
  puppeteerOptions: {
    executablePath: '/usr/bin/chromium-browser'
  }
}
```

## Dealing with dynamic data

Sometimes components render dynamic data, such as dates, or random data. This creates a challenge when testing these components. The way we recommend to address this issue is to insert code into your storybook which normalizes the data (uses fixed dates, or a specific seed), when it is being run in an automated environment.

Eyes storybook makes it possible for components to be aware that they are being tested. There will be a specific query parameter on the URL of the story's iframe: `?eyes-storybook=true`.

This way it's possible to write a story like this:

```js
const isBeingTested =
    new URL(window.location).searchParams.get('eyes-storybook')

const SOME_FIXED_DATE = 354060000000

const date = new Date(isBeingTested ? SOME_FIXED_DATE : undefined)

storiesOf('Some kind', module).add('Date', () => <div>{date}</div>)
```

## Storybook interactions Play functionality

Since version 3.28.0, there is a support for Storybooks' Interactions Play functionality: Stories who use 'Play', screenshot will be taken _automatically_ after the 'Play' flow is done.
This will replace the existing point of taking screenshots, it should not affect any new or existing Stories which are **not** using the 'Play' functionality.
Tests that use the _`waitBeforeCapture`_ property, the wait period will begin **after** the 'Play' flow is done.
You can read more at Storybook interactions documentation:
https://storybook.js.org/docs/react/essentials/interactions
